          # RUSTSEC-2023-0071 - Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels (rsa crate)
          # Reason for ignore: Vulnerable code is not actually used
          # Explanation:
          # The 'rsa' crate is pulled in by the 'sqlx-mysql' crate. The 'sqlx-mysql' crate
          # is only pulled in because we use the `migrate` feature of `sqlx`. However, we
          # only use the postgres and sqlite DB drivers.
