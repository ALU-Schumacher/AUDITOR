# AUDITOR

**AUDITOR** is a modular accounting ecosystem that is able to cover
a wide range of use cases and infrastructures. Accounting data is gathered via so-called col-
lectors which are designed to monitor batch systems, COBalD/TARDIS, cloud schedulers or
other sources of information. The data is stored in a database and the access to the data
is handled by the core component of AUDITOR which provides a REST API, and both
a Rust and a Python client. So-called plugins can take action based on accounting records.
